# Simulating Valence Dependent Attentional Biases in Anxiety Disorders

## Overview
This is a final project for PSY/COS 454: Probabilistic Models of Cognition

This research explores modeling attention bias and risk avoidance in simplified planning tasks. See [Peril, prudence and planning as risk, avoidance and worry](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022249621000857) and [People construct simplified mental representations to plan](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04743-9).

## Code Organization

Most code (simulations, graphs, etc.) are found in `PSY454_cvar.ipynb`. 

With the exception of several `2D_optimal_policy_nCVaR...npz` files, everything in `plotting`, `shared`, and `simulation_results` are the same as those in Chris Gagne's repository.


## Credits
The code in this repository pulls heavily from [Chris Gagne's CVaR repository](https://github.com/crgagne/cvar_jmathpsych_2021).
